Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of Linux commands to manage files and directories effectively. It covers tasks such as checking file and directory details, modifying permissions, and working with hidden files. These operations are fundamental for system administration and maintaining secure, organized file systems.

Check File and Directory Details
This section explains how to retrieve detailed information about files and directories using Linux commands such as ls and stat.

Command Used:
ls -l – Displays file details, including permissions, owner, size, and modification date.
stat <filename> – Provides comprehensive metadata about a file or directory.

Example Output:

csharp
Copy code
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Jan 1 12:00 example.txt
Describe the Permissions String
Linux file permissions are represented as a string of 10 characters. Here's what they mean:

First Character: Indicates the file type:

- for regular files
d for directories
l for symbolic links
Next 9 Characters: Indicate read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for:

Owner (rw-)
Group (r--)
Others (r--)
Change File Permissions
Use the chmod command to modify file permissions.

Command Syntax:
chmod [options] mode filename

Examples:

Grant executable permissions to the owner: chmod u+x script.sh
Remove write permissions for the group: chmod g-w document.txt
Change File Permissions on a Hidden File
Hidden files in Linux start with a dot (.). To change permissions for such files:

Command Example:
chmod g-r .hiddenfile
This sets the file to be readable and writable only by the owner.
Change Directory Permissions
Directory permissions determine who can list, create, or delete files within the directory.

Command Syntax:
chmod [options] mode directory

Grant full access to the owner: chmod 700 mydir
Allow read and execute permissions for everyone: chmod 755 public
Summary
This project showcases essential Linux file and directory management commands, emphasizing permission handling for both visible and hidden files. By mastering these commands, users can secure their system
